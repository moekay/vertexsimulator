Release notes/change log for VERTEX

See also the README file


--------- Version 0.91 (Nov 06 2014) ---------

Added neuronDynamics() function for testing neurone model dynamics prior to a network simulation. Also added step current input model.

Added possibility to modify runSimulation() to allow multiple simulation runs within runSimulation(), with model parameters changing but dynamical variables not being reset between runs

Added functionality to allow loadResults() to return the LFP due to each (postsynaptic) neurone group independently

Added functionality to plotSpikeRaster to plot spikes from a subset of neurons, set the marker size, and x-axis limits

Bug fixes: fixed minor spike recording bug, corrected setRandomSeed() behaviour, corrected LFP calculation (missing minus sign means previous LFP calculations would have had the wrong sign)


--------- Version 0.9 (Jun 14 2014) ---------

First public release, as described in the paper but with added random number seeding control

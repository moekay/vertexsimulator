Release notes/change log for VERTEX

See also the README file

--------- Version 0.93 (Nov 8 2015) ---------

Added specific checks to prevent synaptic time constants being intialised to <= 0

Bug fixes: fixed i_step input current problems (now works in parallel and if timeOn = 0), fixed a synaptic current summation bug for point neuron models with no synapses, fixed a bug that broke the simulation if the sample rate and maxRecTime were incompatible, fixed a bug that broke the simulation if some neuron groups had input currents specified but others didn't

--------- Version 0.92 (Jul 14 2015) ---------

Added support for new Matlab parpool() implementation (VERTEX automatically chooses whether to use matlabpool() or parpool() based on detected Matlab version)

Now allows passive parameter values to be specified per-compartment in a vector

Bug fixes: fixed bug that caused z-positioning errors for neurons in some cases, fixed error leading to extra spikes being plotted by plotSpikeRaster() for parallel simulations, fixed the loadResults() documentation

--------- Version 0.91 (Nov 06 2014) ---------

Added neuronDynamics() function for testing neurone model dynamics prior to a network simulation. Also added step current input model.

Added possibility to modify runSimulation() to allow multiple simulation runs within runSimulation(), with model parameters changing but dynamical variables not being reset between runs

Added functionality to allow loadResults() to return the LFP due to each (postsynaptic) neurone group independently

Added functionality to plotSpikeRaster() to plot spikes from a subset of neurons, set the marker size, and x-axis limits

Bug fixes: fixed minor spike recording bug, corrected setRandomSeed() behaviour, corrected LFP calculation (missing minus sign means previous LFP calculations would have had the wrong sign)


--------- Version 0.9 (Jun 14 2014) ---------

First public release, as described in the paper but with added random number seeding control
